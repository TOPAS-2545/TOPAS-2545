# Introduction

This repo contains the example implememtations for the "Intelligent Transport Systems â€” Interface Protocol and Message Set Definition between Traffic Signal Controllers and Detectors" (ISO10711). 

## TODO

* [x] Move golang deps under the TOPAS repo
* [ ] Add description of how the golang system works
* [x] Add test framework
* [ ] Add Licence
* [ ] Add Docker version for easier testing

# Description

The example contains a C, golang and python implementation of the ISO10711. It does not contain the actual ISO10711 ASN as this is not currently distrobutable. 

# Requirements

The example has been designed to run under linux. 

It uses the following tools

* Python3
* asn1c (https://github.com/vlm/asn1c)
* A copy of the ISO1711.asn and ISO14927-1.asn ASN1 Files. 

# Running

It is possible to test the build and run stages without the ASN1 files, to do this type:

    make build_all run_all
    
This will convert the source files into binary files that are then run. 

If the ASN1 is available, the additional generation and testing stages can be used:

    make generate_all build_all run_all test_all
    
This will re-generate the source code from the ASN1 and then builds it, runs and test the results.

# Description

## Python example

The Python example uses the asn1tools to perform the conversions. This is mainly used for the testing framework.

## C example

The C example uses asn1c (https://github.com/vlm/asn1c).  

## golang

The golang system uses a third-party systems to convert the ASN1 into golang structures. It also uses a forked version of the encoders/asn1 system package because it does not support REAL types.
